Highly detailed graphics and a refined user interface allow you to quickly create new robot motions such as crouching, crawling, jumping, rolling, walking and climbing.  Combine your motions in a control sequence to solve the game's challenging obstacle courses.  Compete against your friends and rivals to move to the top of the leader board for each level.  You are rewarded for sharing motions with the Xemo community, and can continue to improve your robot's performance using better, faster and more efficient motions. How fast and agile is your robot?
