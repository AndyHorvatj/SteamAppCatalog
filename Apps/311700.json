The gods are desperate to restore their immortality and regain their place at the zenith of the world. Only you possess the strength of will powerful enough to stop history repeating and end their tyranny once and for all.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nCan you make your own miracle and kill the gods?<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThere are Six Realms of Magic in BloodRealm: Chaos, Order, Nature, Myth, Shadow and Light.
