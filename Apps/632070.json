After a violent plane crash, Stanley must search a desolate frozen island in search of his wife Leonore while covering up any traces of their identity.

We use the opera's premise as inspiration for the backstory, then re-imagined it for a modern setting.<br \/>\r\n <br \/>\r\nMichael Krikorian's score composes over 40 minutes of original music.  He incorporates themes from Fidelio's overture and transforms them to fit the mood and atmosphere of the game.
