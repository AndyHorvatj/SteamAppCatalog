Each enemy wave is preceded by a setup phase in which the player can check what types of enemies are going to be attacking him and to observe their paths. There is no time limit for this phase, so the player can carefully plan his defenses or choose to start fighting immediately and place towers when needed during the battle. One of the game's key features is the ability to build towers virtually anywhere on the map and to shape enemy paths by connecting towers with laser fences. The player can choose between building long mazes out of basic towers or placing more advanced towers which are more effective at different types of incoming enemies. Advanced tower types specialize in dealing with specific enemy types e.g. flame towers are great for destroying fast moving ground units, artillery towers are best at countering large groups of slow enemies, anti air laser is ideal for shooting down heavy bombers.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/408410\/extras\/xmorph_shooter_600x338.png?t=1491481753\"><\/h2><br>As the X-Morph fighter you can engage enemy units directly with a diverse arsenal of weapons. You can morph into four distinct forms which specialize in dealing with different kinds of threats. Each form has a basic attack and a special charged attack mode. The Plasma Fighter is the most universal form - good at destroying both air and ground units. The Dark Matter Bomber is great at decimating groups of ground units. It can also slow down time and release a dark matter bomb that can cut down buildings. The Shredder fighter is perfect for annihilating large numbers of human air units and clearing the sky. Finally the Laser Destroyer is best for smelting large single units. It can also charge up a gravitational anomaly that sucks in smaller enemy units.  A large variety of weapons and enemies along with a dynamic, fully destructible environment provides a rich arcade shooter experience.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/408410\/extras\/enviro_header.png?t=1491481753\"><\/h2><h2 class=\"bb_tag\"><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/408410\/extras\/xmorph_destruction2_600x338.png?t=1491481753\"><\/h2><br>The game's environments are constructed with a lot of attention to detail and they are almost completely destructible.
