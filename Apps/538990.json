The game happens in the early days when Europeans were settling in the Caribbean. It has a heavy component in person and buildings micro management. As well as an economical and trading aspect.<br><br>The player starts with a few families and a storage full of supplies, you will try to survive and thrive your settlement.

Some food items expire sooner than others. <br><br><\/li><li> Thirst: People need to drink water to survive. One of the challenges of the game is to keep their thirst quenched. (In real life we can only survive 3 days without water)<br><br><\/li><li> Measurements: No more 10 units of wood and 5 of iron to build a building. Be ready to gather 300KG of wood, and 10KG of nails to build a shack. Can you guess how much is needed for a brick house?<br><br><\/li><li> Horse Carriages: As the game has real measurements people can carry only so much. That's when horse-drawn carriages come into place. They carry a lot more, as a result, your economy gets boosted. A person in their best years might carry around 15KG, wheelbarrows closer to 60KG, but the smaller cart can carry 240KG.<br><br><\/li><li> Usage of goods: Crates, barrels, wheelbarrows, carts, tools, cloth, crockery, furniture and utensils are all needed to do the traditional activities of a town. As these goods get used, they diminish, as a result, a person won't carry anything if there are no crates. Keep an eye on that ;)<br><br><\/li><li> Happiness: People's happiness is influenced by various factors. How much money they have, food variety, religion satisfaction, access to leisure, house comfort and education level. Also if a person has utensils, crockery and cloth will influence their happiness.<br><br><\/li><li> Port reputation: You can perform traditional trade activities such as importing and exporting any product. This indicator identifies how often ships come to your port.<br><br><\/li><li> Pirate threat: Pirates were still around. This indicator identifies the risks of suffering a pirate attack. If that happens your game is over. You can decrease this by constructing military buildings.<br><br><\/li><li> Views\/Camera: The game has the traditional city building camera and also allows you to go to ground level and get a closer look at your people. <br><br><\/li><li> Buildings: Over 50 different buildings to construct. House models randomly select their textures.<br><br><\/li><li> Products: Over 80 different products.<br><br><\/li><li> Line production: To make a simple nail you need to mine ore, in the foundry melt the iron, and finally in the blacksmith make the nail.
