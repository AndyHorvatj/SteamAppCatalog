You speak with robots (or type) to investigate a mystery or to command them to do things. Robot actions and answers depend 100% on your commands, questions or location - taking interactivity and immersion to a new level.","supported_languages":"English<strong>*<\/strong><br><strong>*<\/strong>languages with full audio support","reviews":"\u201cDespite...my occasional exasperation with Jimmy, it turns out I enjoy the hell out of telling robots to do things and then watching them do things. When it works, it\u2019s oddly satisfying. When it doesn\u2019t work, it\u2019s generally amusing.\u201d<br><a href=\"http:\/\/www.rockpapershotgun.com\/2014\/07\/07\/bot-colony-alpha-review\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer\"  >Rock, Paper, Shotgun<\/a><br><br>\u201cIt\u2019s not exactly Blade Runner\u2018s Voight Kampff test, but few, if any, games, offer this level of unscripted interaction. The game\u2019s use of voice synthesis, which makes sense in this context, means that all the robots are fully voiced. Their pronunciation isn\u2019t always dead on, though I still grinned like an idiot when I was able to get Jimmy to address me as Bruce Wayne. I spent a good hour picking through Jimmy\u2019s recollections and even though we weren\u2019t discussing anything deep, it was curiously satisfying.  In its current state, Bot Colony definitely has promise, provided that the game\u2019s developers build on the quality of \u2018Intruder\u2019.\u201d<br><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/www.gamespew.com\/2017\/03\/bot-colony-preview\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >GameSpew<\/a><br><br>\u201cObjectively speaking this is becoming a good game since it\u2019s in early access it\u2019s impossible to speak for the final version. It dares to put a lot of eggs in the user\u2019s input basket which pays off as talking to robots is fun. However it has a learning curve and requires good spoken or written English depending on your chosen input option. As a side note, robots don\u2019t find potty humor funny.\u201d<br><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/3rd-strike.com\/bot-colony-review\/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >http:\/\/3rd-strike.com\/bot-colony-review\/<\/a><br>","header_image":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/263040\/header.jpg?t=1495631023","website":"http:\/\/www.botcolony.com","pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Windows 7 64-bit [make sure you have 64-bit Windows!]<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> Dual Core 3.5GHz \/ Quad Core 2.40 GHz greater<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 4 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> NVidia GTS 240 (1 GB VRAM) or greater, ATI Radeon HD 4850 (1 GB VRAM) or greater<br><\/li><li><strong>DirectX:<\/strong> Version 9.0c<br><\/li><li><strong>Network:<\/strong> Broadband Internet connection<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 4 GB available space<br><\/li><li><strong>Sound Card:<\/strong> Yes<br><\/li><li><strong>Additional Notes:<\/strong> Internet connection required.
