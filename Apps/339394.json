On the other hand, it must be said that most of the taxiways, aprons and some car parking areas have a yellow grey concrete which, looking to real photos, is reflecting reality.\u201d<br><a href=\"https:\/\/steamcommunity.com\/linkfilter\/?url=http:\/\/asn-xp.aerosoft.com\/?page_id=15667\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"  >ASN X-Plane<\/a><br>","header_image":"https:\/\/steamcdn-a.akamaihd.net\/steam\/apps\/339394\/header.jpg?t=1490957767","website":"http:\/\/www.aerosoft.com","pc_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Windows XP\/Vista\/7\/8\/8.1\/10<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> 3 GHz, multi-core CPU (or, even better, multiple processors)<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 8 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> with 2 GB of on-board, dedicated VRAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 2 GB available space<\/li><\/ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Windows XP\/Vista\/7\/8\/8.1\/10<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> 3 GHz, multi-core CPU (or, even better, multiple processors)<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 16 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> with 4 GB of on-board, dedicated VRAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 2 GB available space<\/li><\/ul>"},"mac_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> OS X version 10.6.8 or later<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> 3 GHz, multi-core CPU (or, even better, multiple processors)<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 8 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> with 2 GB of on-board, dedicated VRAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 2 GB available space<\/li><\/ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> OS X version 10.6.8 or later<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> 3 GHz, multi-core CPU (or, even better, multiple processors)<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 16 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> with 4 GB of on-board, dedicated VRAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 2 GB available space<\/li><\/ul>"},"linux_requirements":{"minimum":"<strong>Minimum:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Linux Ubuntu 12.04LTS or compatible<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> 3 GHz, multi-core CPU (or, even better, multiple processors)<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 8 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> with 2 GB of on-board, dedicated VRAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 2 GB available space<\/li><\/ul>","recommended":"<strong>Recommended:<\/strong><br><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li><strong>OS:<\/strong> Linux Ubuntu 12.04LTS or compatible<br><\/li><li><strong>Processor:<\/strong> 3 GHz, multi-core CPU (or, even better, multiple processors)<br><\/li><li><strong>Memory:<\/strong> 16 GB RAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Graphics:<\/strong> with 4 GB of on-board, dedicated VRAM<br><\/li><li><strong>Storage:<\/strong> 2 GB available space<\/li><\/ul>"},"legal_notice":"The manual, documentation, video images, software, and all the related materials are copyrighted and cannot be copied, photocopied, trans- lated or reduced to any electronic medium or machine legible form, neither completely nor in part, without the previous written consent of AEROSOFT.
