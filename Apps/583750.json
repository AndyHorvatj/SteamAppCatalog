Use your amazing climbing abilities to reach new heights, fling yourself over large gaps, and even jump from wall to wall. Unlock new tools such as the magnetic-hookshot and paraglider to help explore the magical world of Tarouke. Mount your guardian companion and grab your bow and arrow if you want to go hunting.<br \/>\r\n <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nScene Descriptions and Content:<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nOpening Scene : You start on a small boat that is traversing through a magical cave. After this sequence you arrive on a small island inside of a large canyon. This scene requires the player to climb up the top of the building in the center of the island. Upon activating the magical beacon, you start to ascend into the sky.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nGarden of Time  -  The beacon you activated has now brought you to a new world, Tarouke. The garden of time is at the center of the map. The garden is a large, open environment filled with lush foliage and a pristine lake. Our first NPC character is also found in this scene inside of a giant treehouse. This scene also leads to 3 &quot;Dojos&quot; which are part of the games narrative. <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nTreehouse - Inside of the massive tree is Blashm, one of the Shoi elders. His humble abode has books and furniture that can be interacted with. If you talk to Blashm he will inform you about the land and provide you with insight about your adventure. At the top of the treehouse is a balcony, which oversees the entire world of Tarouke.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nDojo Scenes - The Garden of Time has 3 dojos that get progressively more difficult and build upon previously learned mechanics. The dojos are essentially a climbing obstacle course that tests the players skills. The guardian eagle Aldor will oversee your dojo challenge and reward you with a new ability if you can complete it.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSouthern Forest - After completing all 3 dojos, Blashm tells you to meet him at the treehouse balcony. From here, you climb on top of the guardian eagle aldor and he flies you into towards the south. In the southern forest, there are massive trees, wild beasts and local natives of Tarouke. In this forest, you will find the paraglider and meet your companion guardian, Aoni.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nFuture Updates<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nWe plan on releasing major content updates within chapters. Currently we are in the chapter 1 beta. Each chapter we want to spend approximately 3 months developing. With each new chapter, there will be 1 large scene with several sub-scenes within it, new quests for the narrative and new abilities will be unlocked.  We also want to release multiplayer into beta stage, where it will remain in beta most likely until full release of the game.","about_the_game":"Game Synopsis <br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nSky Climbers is an Open World Adventure\/Platformer game developed for the HTC Vive.
