This Quantum Levitation effect allows the craft to skim along the track at incredibly high speeds whilst remaining suspended above the track surface. Magnetic side buffers create an invisible barrier to dampen impact at high speeds whilst holographic digital elements serve to update your HUD with visual feedback. <br><br><strong><u>Weapon Technology<\/u><\/strong><br>You are able to research new technology to add to craft weapon slots, which you can activate during race-time. Weapons and counter-measures in Formula Fusion are all digital. Once you use one you will need to re-charge them to reactivate them again. This will allow the player to choose to be either aggressive or defensive and as you progress through the craft stages more slots will be made available. <br><br><strong><u>Handling and Features<\/u><\/strong><br>With enhancements to the traditional way of AG craft handling we have developed our own hybrid, a mixture of physics and spline control.
