{"293400":{"success":true,"data":{"type":"game","name":"Epic Space: Online","steam_appid":293400,"required_age":0,"is_free":false,"detailed_description":"<h1>Just Updated<\/h1><p><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">NEW! TACTICAL MAP<\/h2>As we continue development on our squadron update, we thought it would be a great time to introduce the new Tactical Map (TACM). This map provides a bird's eye view of the sector and helps pilots track various points of interest.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Here's a quick rundown of the latest stuff:<\/h2><ul class=\"bb_ul\"><li>New! Respawn Points<br><\/li><li>Asteroid Base Changes<br><\/li><li>Profile Avatars<br><\/li><li>Profile Badges<br><\/li><li>Outpost HP Modifications<br><\/li><li>Courier Hud Icons<br><\/li><li>Ship Leveling and XP System<br><\/li><li>Ship Selling<br><\/li><li>Tweaks to Voice Comm Records<br><\/li><li>New! Tactical Map<br><\/li><li>New! Points\/Awards System<br><\/li><li>New! Hangar Bay (Where your ships are listed)<br><\/li><li>Notifications V2<\/li><\/ul><br>We've also introduced the new &quot;Flight&quot; system, which can also be viewed from the Tactical Map (TACM) and tracks all the objectives you've completed in the current game session.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Respawn Points<\/h2>When you die in an enemy sector, you'll have the option to respawn! As long as you have a spare ship and a enemy comm array is under your faction's control, you'll be able to spawn near it.<br><br>But be warned: Comm Arrays can be retaken by the faction that hosts them.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Asteroid Base Changes<\/h2>Asteroid bases can be installed directly into an asteroid! We've also done away with platforms and landing pads. For now, simply grab a construction beam, select a hangar, and place the marker directly into an Asteroid to begin your construction.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">New: Avatars<\/h2>This is something we never got the chance to polish in ES Classic. So we're so excited to talk about this feature -- Avatars. They play such an important role as they allow you to easily recognize other players. The awesomest thing? We support animated gifs!<br><br>No, the even awesomer thing? Is that they appear when you mouse over a ship!<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">New: Profile Badges<\/h2>Kickstarter Backers, Founders, Marines, Squids, Coasties, Dog Faces, Flyboys, and Bubbleheads can all get an icon representing their branch applied to their ES:O profile. Kickstarter backers should automatically see their badge on their profile. But if you're missing one, contact us on Discord.<br><br>Members of the US Armed forces, go here.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Outpost HP Modifications<\/h2>We've brought the health down for all Outposts to between 200-400 hp depending on the outpost's distance from the primary station. This results in outposts that are easier to destroy... for now. We're working on outfitting them with some defense turrets to even the odds. (Possibly this month)<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Courier Hud Icons<\/h2>We've applied the new ship friend or foe icons that we introduced in February to NPC couriers. White is good, red is bad.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Ship Leveling and XP System<\/h2>Ships can now be leveled up to a cap of 5! Leveling up your ship will allow you to mount more powerful turrets and retrofits that otherwise would not be available at lower levels.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Ship Selling<\/h2>Pilots can now sell any ship over level 2 for a little extra cash. Head to your hangar bay at Bradford or Hadfield Station and click the sell icon to begin the listing process.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Voice Communication Timestamps<\/h2>Voice communication timestamps have been tweaked to be more readable. By determining the age of a comm record, you can more easily guess the source's current location.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">New: Tactical Map<\/h2>Designed to support our upcoming &quot;Squadron Update&quot;, the tactical map will allow pilots to easily collaborate on various objectives in game. Upon death, pilots will use this map to select a new spawn point.<br><br>Press M to bring up the TACM.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">New: Flight PTS System<\/h2>Pilots are now tracked and awarded for what they complete in a single session!<br><br>NPC Kills: 100 PTS<br>PVP Kills: 500 PTS<br>Outpost Destroyed: 200 PTS<br>Comm Array Procurement: 100 PTS<br>Confirmed Hits on Ships (NPC or PVP): 1 PT<br>Mined Resource (in Enemy Sector): 1 PT<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">New: Hangar Bay<\/h2>A new Hangar Bay option is available on the PDA. From this interface you can see all of your owned ships, their statuses, and what they have mounted. (At the currently docked station)<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Notifications V2<\/h2>A much improved notification system has been installed. This new system lets players know if they've recently earned XP, credits, or have connection problems.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Updated Reddit Page<\/h2>We've updated our subreddit over at \/r\/EpicSpace. We check this page regularly for new ideas and tech issues! Go check it out! But don't forget: We're on Discord.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Chat: Discord Integration<\/h2>We've integrated Discord directly into the game and is available in three channels: General, Trading, and Help. Players chatting in these channels will see each other whether they are on a Discord client, docked in a station, or in flight.<h2 class=\"bb_tag\">Frictionless Tutorial Missions<\/h2>Based on the feedback received in January, we've modified several parts of the tutorial that kept players from progressing.<\/p><br><h1>About the Game<\/h1><img src=\"http:\/\/cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com\/steam\/apps\/293400\/extras\/Bottom_Optimized_N.png?t=1494448883\"><h2 class=\"bb_tag\">One Server, Shared by All<\/h2>One shared persistent sandbox\/universe, shared by the entire world.
