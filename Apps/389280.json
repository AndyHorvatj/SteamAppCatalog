Based on benchmark technology, FSW includes the whole world as well as several single and twin propeller aircraft to get you started. <br><br>The aircraft in Flight Sim World have been created using the latest modelling and rendering technologies resulting in stunning realism and detail. Every switch and gauge in the cockpits are clickable, while a range of animations really brings the experience to life.<br><br>Not only do the core aircraft look amazing, but they also react to their environment realistically.
