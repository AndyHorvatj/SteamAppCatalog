Nobody has come from the saving ark yet, but this place has been settled the flocks of birds. How the earth was before the disaster you can't know, but the disaster can be repeated if you don't follow the Guide and go your own way. The path is close to you at the time, but the farther you go after the Guide, the time is increasingly moving away from you.<br \/>\r\n<br \/>\r\nThe game is an action-platformer from the first person. It simultaneously reminds and &quot;Mirror's Edge&quot; and &quot;Dear Esther&quot;. The player is in a critical situation and should immediately focus on a large space - a real hardcore challenge.

New running mechanics will allow you to feel each step, creating the feeling that you're really running, not just clicking. The plot is based on the basis of the musical creativity of the eponymous group.","about_the_game":"Are you able to love without cognition of freedom?
