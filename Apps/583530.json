If you have a Vive and are keen to try Aquila, please use the community hub to let me know.  Thank you for your continued patience!<\/p><br><h1>If you have the Oculus Home version of Aquila ...<\/h1><p>... then I can issue you with a complimentary key for Aquila on Steam, once the OpenVR conversion is complete. If anything the simulator runs much smoother in OpenVR, so I can recommend it. Please get in touch.<\/p><br><h1>About the Game<\/h1><strong>Have you dreamed of what it would be ... to soar like an eagle?<\/strong><br><br>Aquila Bird Flight Simulator lets you experience soaring bird flight using virtual reality.  It was originally designed for the Oculus Rift, but has now been modified for OpenVR.\u00a0 You embody one of three species of eagle flying over either Northwest Scotland, a part of Columbia, or Graham Island in British Columbia. This is designed as a relaxing soaring flight simulation, and is not arcade-style flight, and as such you can make use of ridge lift and thermals.  If you want a work out try flapping with motion controllers!<br><br>Proceeds from this project go towards a major bird of prey centre in Hampshire (UK), where I do voluntary work. Supporting this project helps towards vital conservation, rehabilitation, and education schemes throughout the UK and overseas.
