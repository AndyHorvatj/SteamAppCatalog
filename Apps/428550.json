I'm Dan, the Senior Content Manager at Playism. I feel very strongly about how much I love Momodora: RUtM and I wanted to share a few words about it.<br><br>I grew up on games starting with the early days of the NES and throughout the years action platforming has been a staple genre among my absolute favorites. Long before Metroidvania was a thing I was infatuated with the original Castlevanias, with Metroid, Contra, Ninja Gaiden and the like. About halfway through the PlayStation's life cycle, sprite-based game development took a nosedive and the games I loved best just weren't being made as often as they used to.<br><br>Indie game development reinvigorated the genre and the magic of actual sprite animation. rdein's games combine what I always loved about tight action gaming in 2D spaces with splendid influence from modern games like Dark Souls which I am actually playing right now. The way you have to dedicate yourself to the actions you take because of animation locks, the insane intensity driving the boss fights and how epic it is that little ole me can tackle these heroic endeavors, the attention to detail in the environments, designs, animations--all of this stuff is simply stunning and rdein pulls it off to beautiful effect.<br><br>And of course I love the story--a strange mystery world that you inhabit with many others: hopeless souls whom you are trying to save. There is detail in every item, every moment of dialog. You're constantly readjusting how you feel about these people. You're trying to save them, but do they even want to be saved? Or should you be more worried about that awkwardly sinister tone in their voices...<br><br>I wouldn't call Momodora: RUtM a metroidvania or a Souls-like, but there are elements of both in there. It's a game of its own and its one of the best entries in the oceanically broad genre of side-scrolling action. I love it and I'm hella confident that you will too.","about_the_game":"Momodora: Reverie Under the Moonlight explores a cursed land in decline. Evil spreads, the dead rise, and corruption reigns.
